                    Most people think the bottom of the ocean is like a giant bathtub 
                    filled with mud—boring, flat and dark. But it contains the largest 
                    mountain range on earth, canyons far grander than the Grand Canyon and 
                    towering vertical cliffs rising up three miles—more than twice the height 
                    of Yosemite’s celebrated El Capitan.</p></div>

                    Ocean exploration is about making discoveries, searching for 
                    things that are unusual and unexpected. Ocean exploration, however, 
                    is not randomly wandering in hopes of finding something new. It is 
                    disciplined and organized and includes rigorous observations and 
                    documentation of biological, chemical, physical, geological, and 
                    archaeological aspects of the ocean.</p></div>
