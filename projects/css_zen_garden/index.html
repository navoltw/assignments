                <p>
                    Littering a dark and dreary road lay past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible
                    <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>s broken <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
                    support, and abandoned browsers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts 
                    of folk like the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>, <abbr title="Web Standards Project">WASP</abbr>, and 
                    the major browser creators.

                <p>
                    There is a continuing need to show the power of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.
                    The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire,and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the 
                    existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very 
                    page. The <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> remains the same, the only thing that has 
                    changed is the external <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file. Yes, really.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows complete and total control over the style 
                    of a hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated 
                    in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly 
                    be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty 
                    from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; 
                    we can always push it further.

                    Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this 
                    page, so strong <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> skills are necessary too, but the example files are 
                    commented well enough that even <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> CSS novices can use them as starting 
                    points. Please see the <a href="#">CSS Resource Guide</a> for advanced tutorials and 
                    tips on working with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. 
                    This may seem daunting at first if you’ve never worked this way before, 
                    but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.

                    Download the sample <a href="#">HTML</a> and <a href="#">CSS</a> to work on a copy locally. 
                    Once you have completed your masterpiece 
                    (and please, don’t submit half-finished work) upload your 
                    <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file to a web server under your control. 
                    <a href="#">Send us a link</a> to an archive of that file and all associated assets, and if 
                    we choose to use it we will download it and place it on our server.

                        those working on the web today, learning tool for those who will be

                <h3>Requirements</h3>
                <p>
                        Where possible, we would like to see mostly <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS 1 & 2</abbr> usage. 
                        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS 3 & 4</abbr> should be limited to 
                        widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. 
                        The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> 
                        and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement 
                        we have is that your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> validates.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Luckily, designing this way shows how well various 
                        browsers have implemented <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> by now. When sticking 
                        to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent 
                        results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number 
                        of user agents on the web these days — especially when you factor in 
                        mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every 
                        platform. That’s okay, but do test in as many as you can. 
                        Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest 
                        Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers 
                        (run by over 90% of the population).

                        interesting visual themes to your work. We’re well past 
                        the point of needing another garden-related design.
