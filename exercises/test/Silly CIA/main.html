                    <p><br>LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General 
                        revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical 
                        intelligence information with black highlighters.</br><br>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are 
                        marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret 
                        highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</br><br><br></br><b>CIA Director Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the 
                        particulars of several historic events, such as:</br></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the Cold War</li>                
                        <li>the civil-rights movement</li>                
                        <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>                
                    </ul>
