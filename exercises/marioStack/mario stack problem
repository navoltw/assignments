Good morning everyone!  Quick optional warm up exercise:  
Create a function which takes a single character and 
prints out the 'Mario Steps', where the base is 5 chars long,
 the next has a leading single space and then 4 charachters, 
 and so on. (sorry if the spacing is off on the example below)

 console.log(function(#)
